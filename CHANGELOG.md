### Breaking Changes:

* We removed `braiins.bos.v1.MinerModel` enumeration and changed type of `model` field in `braiins.bos.v1.MinerIdentity` to `string`. Replacing model enumeration with string eliminates the need to release a new version every time we add support for new model,

## [1.0.0-beta.2] - 2023-08-10
Version **1.0.0-beta.2** extends performance management and Pool Group management possibilities. It also introduces an API to get Mining Status.

#### Enhanced Performance Options
We have extended the alternatives for performance tuning in this release.

##### Hashrate Target Introduction
Formerly, users could only configure power target values. Now, we made it possible to define hashrate targets as well.

##### Dynamic Performance Scaling
This release adds the possibility to configure Dynamic Performance Scaling parameters. Users now can fully optimize their operations to their unique requirements using Public API.

##### Augmented Hashboard Administration
We have extended the hashboards management. Public API now lets users activate or deactivate individual hashboards.

#### Evolved Pool Group Management
Previously only single pool group modifications were possible. We have reworked the Public API to allow addition of new pool groups and removal of existing ones.

#### Introduction of Mining Status
An entirely new API makes its debut, providing concise insights into the mining status of individual devices. The mining status allows users to readily differentiate between paused operations and miners requiring attention or possible repair.

### Added
* Introduction of a new `braiins.bos.v1.PerformanceService::SetDefaultHashrateTarget()` method that allows the user to set the currently configured hashrate target value to default one,
* Introduction of a new `braiins.bos.v1.PerformanceService::SetHashrateTarget()` method that allows the user to set the currently configured hashrate target value to a specific one,

* Introduction of a new `braiins.bos.v1.PerformanceService::DecrementHashrateTarget()` method that allows the user to decrement currently configured hashrate target value,
* Introduction of a new `braiins.bos.v1.MinerService::EnableHashboards()` method that allows user to enable hashboards,
* Introduction of a new `braiins.bos.v1.MinerService::DisableHashboards()` method that allows user to enable hashboards,
* Introduction of a new `braiins.bos.v1.PerformanceService::SetDPS()` method that allows user to configure dynamic performance scaling,
* Introduction of a new `braiins.bos.v1.PerformanceService::SetPerformanceMode()` method that allows the user to set performance mode to one of the modes: manual or tuner,
* Introduction of a new `braiins.bos.v1.PerformanceService::GetActivePerformanceMode()` method that allows the user to read the current performance mode,
* Introduction of a new `braiins.bos.v1.PerformanceService::ListTargetProfiles()` method that allows the user to read the currently used tuner profile,
* Introduction of a new `braiins.bos.v1.MinerService::GetMinerStatus()` method streaming actual miner status.
* Introduction of a new `braiins.bos.v1.PoolService::RemovePoolGroup()` method that allows to remove pools group,
* Introduction of a new `braiins.bos.v1.PoolService::CreatePoolGroup()`,
* Extension of the `braiins.bos.v1.UpdatePoolGroupResponse` message with `group` field that contains updated pool group configuration,
* Extension of the `braiins.bos.v1.TunerConstraints` message with new field `hashrate_target` that contains constraints for hashrate target value,
* Extension of the `braiins.bos.v1.GetMinerStatsResponse` message with new field `power_stats` that contains miner power stats like consumption or efficiency,
* Extension of the `braiins.bos.v1.GetTunerStateResponse` message with new fields:
  * `current_power_target` that contains the current power target,
  * `current_hashrate_target` that contains the current hashrate target,
  * `current_profile` that contains info about the currently used tuner profile,
* Extension of the `braiins.bos.v1.Hashboard` with the new field `enabled` that represents a flag if HB is enabled
* Extension of the `braiins.bos.v1.GetMinerConfigurationResponse` with new fields:
  * `dps` that contain Dynamic Performance Scaling configuration,
  * `hashboard_config` holds information regarding the presently configured hashboard frequency, voltage settings, or the enabled/disabled status of HB,
* Extension of the `braiins.bos.v1.GetConstraintsResponse` message with new fields:
  * `dps_constraints` that contains constraints for Dynamic Performance Scaling configuration,
  * `hashboards_constraints` that contains constraints for hashboards config,
* Extension of the `braiins.bos.v1.Platform` enumeration with new values for CVITEK and Braiins control boards.

### Breaking Changes:
* The service `braiins.v1.bos.TunerService` has been updated to `braiins.v1.bos.PerformanceService` to encompass methods relevant to this service.
* Furthermore, the method `braiins.v1.bos.PerformanceService::SetAbsolutePowerTarget()` has been modified to `braiins.v1.bos.PerformanceService::SetPowerTarget()`, removing the potentially confusing term "Absolute".
* In alignment with the adjusted method name, the request message previously labeled as `braiins.bos.v1.SetAbsolutePowerTargetRequest` has been changed to `braiins.bos.v1.SetPowerTargetRequest`.
* Standardization of modification requests has been enacted, with each request containing a designated `save_action` field located at index 1.
* In anticipation of potential hashboard identifiers incorporating non-numeric characters in the future, adjustments have been made to the hashboards identifier fields, shifting from `uint32` to `string` type.

### Migration Guide:
In order to transition to version **1.0.0-beta.2**, the integration requires implementation of the subsequent adjustments:
* Ensure incorporation of the updated moniker `PerformanceService`. The same applies to usage of the `SetAbsolutePowerTarget` method.
* Verify the seamless functionality of your modification request with the modified index placements within the `save_action` fields.
* Guarantee accurate parsing of the novel string-based hashboard identifiers.
